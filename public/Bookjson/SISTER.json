        "\nIt's been a long time since I haven't been home. The last time I stopped by was just to drop off food, but I haven't been back since I fought with my dad about dropping out of college. Today is the first time in two years that I've been back, and it's my lucky day since my dad was traveling to another province.\n",
        "\n\"Where's View B, Mom?\"\n",
        "\nMom looks at me like she sees a savior, but she is also surprised to see me return because of View B.\n",
        "\n\"Hiding up there in bed. How did you know View was in trouble?\"\n",
        "\n\"I talked to Mike B.\"\n",
        "\n\"Did Mike tell you that?\"\n",
        "\n\"I am curious. Let me go see her first.\"\n",
        "\nI didn't want to explain things to Mom at length, so I went straight to my sister's room and knocked on the door a few times.\n",
        "\nKnock, knock.\n",
        "\n\"View B... It's me, P'May.\"\n",
        "\nSince my return wasn't something that happened often, it wasn't long before View B opened the door, as if to check if it was really me.\n",
        "\n\"P'May.\"\n",
        "\n\"So you're old enough to have your heart broken now?\"\n",
        "\nThe sad expression on my little sister's face made me, who was trying to act tough, slump my shoulders before pulling her into my arms. But it seemed that the more I tried to comfort her, the sadder she got, to the point where she hugged me tightly.\n",
        "\n\"I'm so glad you came, P'May.\"\n",
        "\n\"Do you really love him that much?\"\n",
        "\n\"I don't know. Please give me a hug, P'May.\"\n",
        "\nWe stayed like that, hugging each other, not knowing how much time had passed. View B clung to me like a little monkey, afraid that I might slip away. I almost started to leave if she hadn't pulled away first to wipe her tears.\n",
        "\n\"I made your shirt wet with my tears.\"\n",
        "\n\"Yeah, and it's a new shirt too. It cost over a thousand bahts.\"\n",
        "\n\"That's so mean. I'm already sad...\"\n",
        "\nView B looked around, then opened a drawer as if searching for something before finding some wet wipes. She walked over and started cleaning my shirt.\n",
        "\n\"It's not that bad.\"\n",
        "\n\"It's still a mess.\"\n",
        "\n\"You can take off your shirt, P'May!\"\n",
        "\nHer sarcastic tone made me burst out laughing before I walked over and threw myself on her single bed, which was five feet wide.\n",
        "\n\"It's okay. Watching you cry is kind of funny. So, what's it like to have a broken heart?\"\n",
        "\n\"How much do you know, P'May?\"\n",
        "\nThat question made me shiver a little because I didn't know how much View B knew about being heartbroken, so I gave a basic answer.\n",
        "\n\"I heard from Mike that you were feeling bad. I felt it myself when your replies to my messages were wrong, so I thought I'd come see for myself how bad it was.\"\n",
        "\nI nodded slightly as if assessing the situation.\n",
        "\n\"You look heartbroken like a teenager, just like in music videos and dramas. Don't imitate that too much. We're not on camera, no one sees how pitiful we are more than we do.\"\n",
        "\n\"I'm not in a music video!\"\n",
        "\n\"Oh?\"\n",
        "\n\"And I'm not that sad either.\"\n",
        "\n\"So why were you crying?\"\n",
        "\n\"I just lost a little confidence.\"\n",
        "\nView B said honestly before sitting down next to me.\n",
        "\n\"We’ve been together for so many years, always good friends, and then we decided to try dating. We’ve never fought, but today he suddenly said, 'I’m sorry, View B. You’re too good for me. Let’s break up.'\"\n",
        "\n\"That’s such a basic excuse, too good for him.\"\n",
        "\n\"Yeah, that’s what’s so annoying. So I asked him straight out what was really going on, and he admitted that he liked someone else better. He didn’t want to keep me tied to him. It’s fair, I guess.\"\n",
        "\n\"If it’s fair, then why are you crying?\"\n",
        "\n\"It’s frustrating, even embarrassing. He has someone else, and yet he has the nerve to break up with me. I should have been the one to break up with him, damn, it's so embarrassing. Stupid, stupid, stupid!\"\n",
        "\n\"There's nothing to regret. If you didn't feel that strongly about him, that's a good thing. Besides, a guy who leaves us for someone else doesn't deserve our tears.\"\n",
        "\nI said with a satisfying smile. Finally, I had gotten this unworthy guy out of my little sister's life.\n",
        "\n\"That's what I'm thinking too. I cried because I'm embarrassed about what our friends who knew about our relationship will think. If I meet old friends, they'll ask why we broke up, who broke up with who... it's humiliating!\"\n",
        "\n\"That's why when you have a boyfriend, you shouldn't announce it to everyone.\"\n",
        "\n\"From now on, I won't announce it to anyone. Besides, it's not like finding a boyfriend is easy.\"\n",
        "\nShe wiped her tears, looking so pitiful.\n",
        "\n\"And it's kind of lonely too. We used to talk every day, and now we've become strangers. After the breakup, we're not even friends anymore.\"\n",
        "\n\"He doesn't want to stay friends?\"\n",
        "\n\"I can't be his friend. It's too painful. Ugh!\"\n",
        "\nThen my little sister started crying again, so I pulled her into my arms and rocked her gently as if I were trying to rock a small child to sleep.\n",
        "\n\"My head hurts so much. I must have cried too much.\"\n",
        "\n\"Then sleep.\"\n",
        "\n\"Will you sleep with me?\"\n",
        "\n\"...\"\n",
        "\n\"I can't remember the last time I was able to sleep holding you, P'May. Can I hold you to sleep? I miss your smell, P'May.\"\n",
        "\nShe begged, hugging me tightly.\n",
        "\n\"Stay until I fall asleep, and then you can go.\"\n",
        "\nHer soft little body and the pitiful tone of her voice made it impossible for me to refuse. So I lay down next to her, letting View B climb onto my arm to rest her head. She hugged me tightly, snuggling in, and pressed her face against my chest, inhaling my scent. The faint scent of shampoo in her fine hair made my heart race.\n",
        "\n\"It's so good to have you here, P'May. At least now I know you don't really hate me.\"\n",
        "\nSuddenly, I pulled away and sat up abruptly. View B, who was about to close her eyes, started and sat up in shock.\n",
        "\n\"Did I say something wrong?\"\n",
        "\n\"I don't want to sleep yet. I'm afraid I'll fall asleep and then Dad will come home and see me here. This might lead to another confrontation. I'd better go.\"\n",
        "\nI had let my guard down too much, allowing everything to unfold naturally. It's better for View B to think I don't like her. That way, we'll both be more careful with each other.\n",
        "\nEspecially me, I need to be extra careful or I don't want to give in. Just as I was about to leave, View B grabbed my wrist. I looked at her, curious as to why she was holding me so tightly without meeting my eyes.\n",
        "\nAs if she is about to say something, she slowly loosened her grip and let me go without saying a single word, turning her back to me on the bed without saying goodbye.\n",
        "\n\"Stop crying already. It's just a guy.\"\n",
        "\n\"...\"\n",
        "\n\"I'm leaving now.\"\n",
        "\n\"If I cry now, it won't be because of a guy.\"\n",
        "\n\"Then what will it be about?\"\n",
        "\nEverything went silent. I didn't press her any further because I don't like prying, so I chose to leave. Just as I was about to leave, Mike, who knew I was there, came to greet me. My younger brother smiled widely from afar and hugged me like a small child, forgetting that he was already taller than me.\n",
        "\n\"Seeing you in this house is a miracle. You came back because of View, right? She must be so overwhelmed with happiness.\"\n",
        "\n\"It's probably the opposite. I'm leaving now, so take care of each other.\"\n",
        "\n\"Why are you in such a hurry? Why don't you stay a little longer?\"\n",
        "\n\"I don't want to be around when Dad gets back. I'd rather not hear his sarcastic comments.\"\n",
        "\n\"At least have dinner with us before you go.\"\n",
        "\n\"I'm sure I'll come back someday, but not today. Keep an eye on our sister.\" I waved toward View B's room.\n",
        "\n\"She's feeling sick. Don't leave her alone too long. Make her do something.\"\n",
        "\n\"You really love View B more than she knows, huh?\"\n",
        "\n\"I'd do the same for you, Mike.\"\n",
        "\n\"The cooler you act, the cooler you seem. We shouldn’t have been brothers.\"\n",
        "\nMy playful brother joked, pretending to look dejected. I reached out and pinched his cheek lightly, just enough to let him know I was joking.\n",
        "\n\"I’m leaving now. This doesn’t make sense.\"\n",
        "\n\"I’ll walk you out.\"\n",
        "\nMike B walked me out just like he said. Just as I was about to get in the car, my mischievous little brother nudged me and pointed at View B’s window.\n",
        "\n\"Look who’s peeking. Wave at P'May! She’s leaving now.\"\n",
        "\nThe curtain was then dramatically drawn. I smiled slightly with affection, but then jumped a little when my phone rang, showing Chai’s name. Mike B saw the screen at the same time, which made him comment:\n",
        "\n\"Same guy as View’s boyfriend.\"\n",
        "\n\"I'm really leaving now.\"\n",
        "\nI playfully shoved my brother's hands away, who didn't seem to suspect a thing. I got in the car and answered the call before starting the engine. Mike B ran to open the gate, waiting to close it when I got out, so I had to keep the conversation with Chai brief.\n",
        "\n\"Hey, Chai? Can we talk later? I'm about to drive.\"\n",
        "\n\"You haven't talked to me much these past few days. You haven't responded to my messages, and when I stopped by the store, you said you were too busy to see me. The other day, you even ran into another guy at the store.\"\n",
        "\n\"If you're talking about Mr. Lee, he's not just anyone. I've known him long before you.\"\n",
        "\n\"What do you think of me?\"\n",
        "\nI smiled a little and looked at the rearview mirror. Mike B was watching, waiting to see when I would leave.\n",
        "\n\"I don't think about anything.\"\n",
        "\n\"What do you mean by 'don't think about anything'?\"\n",
        "\n\"Do I need to think about something? You're quite captivating, you know. You're a polite guy, good at drawing, but today I talked to View and it seems like you two broke up, right?\"\n",
        "\n\"I broke up with her because I like...\"\n",
        "\n\"You like me?\"\n",
        "\n\"...\"\n",
        "\n\"You mean in a romantic way?\"\n",
        "\n\"You know as well as I do, our conversations have never been like those between brothers.\"\n",
        "\n\"I don't feel that way. I care about you because you are a polite and humble guy. You have never crossed any boundaries with View B during the entire time you were together. But I think this made you misunderstand. Chai, think about it. I am View's sister. What decent person would steal their sister's boyfriend? And what decent person, who is dating their younger sister, would develop feelings for their older sister?\"\n",
        "\n\"...\"\n",
        "\n\"That means you are not a good person. It is lucky that View broke up with you. A guy who is not steady deserves to be alone.\"\n",
        "\nI smiled, pleased with myself.\n",
        "\n\"You were the one who flirted with me.\"\n",
        "\n\"I didn't even notice. So I apologize if I made you feel bad. That's how love is, someone is bound to get hurt. And another thing...\"\n",
        "\nView B, are you crying over a guy like that? It's a waste. I'll get your revenge.\n",
        "\n\"I'm too good for you. You don't deserve anyone in this world. Goodbye, and let's never meet again.\"\n",
        "\nI hung up, started the car, and pulled out of the garage, smiling widely at Mike B. I was thrilled to have saved my sweet little sister from someone unworthy.\n",
        "\n'P'May, you have such a beautiful smile.'\n",
        "\n'Don't fall in love with me. Every time I smile, people misunderstand.'\n",
        "\nMike B waved goodbye until my car was out of sight.\n",
        "\nIf my smile was considered flirting, then it was beyond my control. I didn't intend it at all.\n"
